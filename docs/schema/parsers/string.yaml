  This parser allows to operate some changes on a string.

  It is currently only useful if you need to read files with a non-unicode encoding.
  Otherwise, while it is possible to declare your own, it would be equivalent to the default one.

  **Default instance:**

  A default instance of this parser is already automatically created as such:
  ```yaml
  name: string
  type: string
  convertFromCharset: ""
  ```
examples:
  - |
    name: shiftJisString
    type: string
    convertFromCharset: "Shift_JIS"
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - name
  - type
properties:
  name:
    type: string

      The name of this parser, which any other component will use to refer to it.
  type:
    const: "string"
  convertFromCharset:
    type: string
    default: ""

      Internally, RODB only handles UTF-8 strings.
      If the given value has a different encoding, RODB will convert it automatically from the encoding set in this value.

      When this value is an empty string, no conversion is performed.

      This setting must match one of the encodings listed in the [IANA character sets index](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml) (either the MIME or Name columns).
