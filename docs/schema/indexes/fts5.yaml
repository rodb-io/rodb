  This is a basic full-text index based on the FTS5 extension of SQLite.

  Contrarily to the other indexes, when using an fts5 index, the only available property to use from the output is `match`. The value of this property can be any fts5 query and is fully equivalent to the `MATCH` operator of SQLite/FTS5.

  You can find more information about the `match` syntax in the [SQLite's documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax).
  The columns available in this query are the same than the list of properties in this index's configuration.
