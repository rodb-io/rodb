title: Wildcard
description: |
  This index is *experimental*.

  The wildcard index can only index strings. It allows to quickly match any substring in the indexed data.
  The index file is automatically generated at startup, unless it has already been created previously.

  It offers a great speed and a simple setup compared to a full-text index, but it's index files can take up a massive amount of space.

  Internally, the wildcard uses a binary prefix-tree to index the data.
examples:
  - |
    name: articleInfo
    type: wildcard
    path: ./articleInfo.rodb
    input: articles
    ignoreCase: true
    properties:
      - title
      - summary
      - content
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - name
  - type
  - path
  - input
