            The path on which the output will be made available on this server (starting with a `/`).
            The path can be any string, but the `{xxx}` (without spaces) placeholders are used to match specific values.
            The name in those placeholders must match the name of one of the `parameters` defined in the related output.
            For example, a placeholder `{id}` will automatically match with an output parameter called `id`.
            Multiple different placeholders are allowed in the same route.
        output:
          type: string
          description: |
            The name of the output object to which this route will be bound.
