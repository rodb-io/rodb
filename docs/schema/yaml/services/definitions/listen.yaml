  The network interface and TCP port to which the server will listen.
  The basic format is `ip:port`. If the port is `0`, it will get assigned a random available port.
  If the IP is omitted(such as `:80`) or `0.0.0.0`, it will listen to the given port number on all interfaces.

  For more implementation details, please refer to the [net.Dial](https://pkg.go.dev/net#Dial) function of Golang.
