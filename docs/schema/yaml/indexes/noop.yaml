  # NoOp index
  This index does not actually index anything.
  It iterates all the records of the data source to find records matching exactly the given filters.

  The reason why it exists is that there is a default index called `default`.
  This is the one used by default from the other layers when no index has been specified.

  While it is possible to declare your own, it would be equivalent to the default one, because there are currently no available settings.

  ### Default instance
  A default instance of this index is already automatically created as such:
  ```yaml
  name: default
  type: noop
  ```
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - name
  - type
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of this index, which any other component will use to refer to it.
  type:
    const: "noop"
