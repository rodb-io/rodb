  # Map index
  The map index uses an in-memory map to index the data.
  It is always created at startup and lost when RODB stops.
  It can only match strictly equal values (including strings).

  While it is limited and can take significant amounts of memory, the advantages of the map index are that retrieving any records is extremely fast, and it's setup is easier, since it does not need to store any file.

  ### Example:
  ```yaml
  name: posts
  type: map
  input: posts
  properties:
    - id
    - status
    - category
    - authorId
  ```
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - name
  - type
  - input
  - properties
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of this index, which any other component will use to refer to it.
  type:
    const: "map"
  input:
    type: string
    description: |
      The input from which to find the data to index.
  properties:
    type: array
    description: |
      The properties whose value must be indexed.
    minItems: 1
