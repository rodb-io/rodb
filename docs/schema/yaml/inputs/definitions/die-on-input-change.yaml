  RODB internally identifies each record using it's binary offset in the file.
  Because of this, any change in the data file while RODB is running can move those offsets, thus corrupting the indexes.
  To avoid returning corrupted data, the default behaviour of RODB is to stop the service with an error whenever it happens.
  While not recommended, setting this property to `false` would prevent RODB from stopping when the data source changes.
