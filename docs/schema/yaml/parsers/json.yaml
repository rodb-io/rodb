type: object
title: JSON
description: |
  Parses a JSON value (string) to any type it contains (object, array...).
  (not to be confused with the JSON input parser)

  While it is possible to declare your own, it would be equivalent to the default one, because there are currently no available settings.

  This parser is not a primitive parser, and thus cannot be used as a parameter in an output object.

  **Default instance**
  A default instance of this parser is already automatically created as such:
  ```yaml
  name: json
  type: json
  ```
examples:
  - |
    name: customJson
    type: json
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - name
  - type
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of this parser, which any other component will use to refer to it.
  type:
    const: "json"
