# Introduction

RODB stands for Read-Only-DataBase.

It's a fast and composable service that allows you to parse, index and publish:
- static data from files: csv, xml, json...
- in multiple formats: json, GraphQL, xml...
- through multiple services: HTTP(s), TCP, Websockets...

It is currently under active development, but not yet ready for production.

More information soon in [our website](https://rodb.io).
